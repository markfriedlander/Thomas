//
//  About.swift
//  Thomas / AI Camera
//
//  A shared "About" surface for the studio.
//
//  Two things live here, deliberately separated so this file can be adopted by
//  every app in the studio:
//
//    1. The SHARED PART — a generic `AboutView` and the vocabulary it needs
//       (`OpenSourceLicense`, `Acknowledgement`) plus the canonical MIT and
//       Apache-2.0 license bodies. This is identical in every app.
//
//    2. The PER-APP DATA — one extension at the bottom (`AboutView.thomas`)
//       that supplies this app's identity and its list of bundled open-source
//       components. This is the ONLY part another app rewrites.
//
//  Why this screen exists at all: MIT and Apache-2.0 both let us use their code
//  freely, on one condition — when we ship that code inside our binary (which is
//  what compiling a dependency into the app is), we must carry its copyright
//  notice and license text along with it. An App Store binary is a sealed
//  bundle, so an in-app screen is the standard, honest way to meet that. This is
//  ONLY for code that ships in the binary; models the user downloads at runtime
//  are never redistributed by us and are surfaced separately, at download time
//  (see `ModelLicenseSheet` in ModelLibraryView).
//

    made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is \
    included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix \

    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial \
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a \
    whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, \
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or \
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative \
    Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original \

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this \
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, \
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to \
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, \
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or \
    Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this \
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, \
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this \
    section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, \
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to \
    those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily \
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their \
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. \
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a \
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a \
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory \
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this \
    License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is \
    filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or \
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in \
    Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy \
    of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that \
    You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You \
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from \
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to \
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, \
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of \
    the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those \
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may \
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, \
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such \
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and \
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in \
    this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any \
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the \
    Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any \
    additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein \
    shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may \
    have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, \
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as \
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the \
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in \
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its \
    Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY \
    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any \
    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or \
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining \
    the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks \

    tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by \
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to \
    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any \
    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any \
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability \
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, \
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other \
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of \
    the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work \
    or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, \
    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations \
